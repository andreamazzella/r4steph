# Intro to R: Practical 8

R is an open-source (i.e. free) alternative to Stata, rapidly growing in popularity. Normally, R is used in conjunction with RStudio, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that streamlines the effective use of the software.  

R has a steeper learning curve than Stata and completing the Stata practicals before turning to the corresponding R practicals is highly encouraged. The initial difficulty in learning R is offset by the greater degree of flexibility and capability achievable with the language with more advanced use (i.e. this guide was written and is maintained entirely through R!)

This guide annotates code as you use it: relevant R concepts and syntax will generally be introduced along the way as they naturally arise in the data analysis process. This means that this guide functions not only as a guide to completing the practicals in R, but also a as a guide to learning R itself.

The suggested way to use this guide is to follow through the relevant section after you finish the equivalent Stata practical. Use the guide in tandem with the R Notebook provided for the practical - the R Notebook will have space for you to enter the appropriate code (given in the guide) and write your response. Try this way of working as you go through this initial section of the guide. The purpose of this section is to give you the very basics to get started in R.

## Opening RStudio

First, open RStudio from the Novell Applications window. Go to File in the top left corner and select Open File, then navigate to and open prac08_intro.Rmd. You should now see four separate panes in RStudio. If this is your initial time setting up RStudio, I strongly suggest navigating to Tools in the upper toolbar then Modify Keyboard Shortcuts. Find `Insert new chunk', click anywhere in the line, and hold Ctrl-Shift-I - we do this overwriting of the command as the standard keyboard shortcut fails on LSHTM computers. You may also wish to go into Tools, then Global Options, then Appearance to find an R theme that works for you (i.e. you can make it dark like Stata if you wish!).

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="What RStudio should look like on opening a new Notebook", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("E:/LSHTM/Teaching/r4steph/panes.PNG")
```

The top left of the four panes is the Notebook. The majority of your coding will be done here. Go ahead and retitle your notebook now, overwriting the default text. The notebook itself is written in R Markdown. R Markdown provides a convenient way of mixing text and code, and also allows you to publish ('knit') your work into an html, Word, or pdf file (as has been done with what you are reading). Areas in your selected background colour in R Markdown are text. Interspersed amongst this text are code 'chunks', denotated by three backticks (`) to close and open them. To run all the code a chunk, click anywhere in the chunk and press Ctrl-Shift-Enter, or press the green triangle in the top right corner of the chunk. To run a single line within a chunk, place your cursor anywhere in the line, and press Ctrl-Enter. Try these ways of running the chunk on the below.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

---

A plot (showing data from one of R's built in datasets) should have appeared directly below the chunk. You should also notice a change in the Console, the pane directly below the Notebook. There should be an additional line "> plot(cars)". This is R's way of letting you know which code has been run. When the code is finished running, at the bottom of the pane, R will show only ">" followed by your cursor. Coding can also be done directly in the console - this is useful for testing out code that you are not sure will work. In general, you want to keep your R Notebook quite clean. Type or copy 'plot(cars)' into the console (or click into the console and hit the up arrow key to scroll through your command history) and press Enter to run it. This time, the plot should have appeared in the bottom right pane, under the "Plots" tab. From here, you can easily export (save) this image using the Export button. 

## Basic Operations

Insert a new chunk using the Ctrl-Shift-I shortcut. In the new chunk, type "1+1", excluding the quotation marks. Run this line of code. Note that when you run the line of code, R evaluates the output and prints it below the chunk, and also in the Console. You can resize the panes by clicking at the edge of a pane and dragging, for example, resizing or minimizing (button in top right of the Console pane) the Console. 

Type now into the chunk, on a new line, "a <- 1+2", again excluding the quotation marks. Run the line of code. It looks like nothing has happened, and nothing has printed below the chunk or in the console. However, in the top right pane, under the "Environment" tab, a new row should have appeared containing "a" and "3". The environment shows any R 'objects'. An object can be data, or a value, or a statistical model, or a function. An object is created by the assignment operator "<-". We assigned the value of "1+1" to the object "a". Now, if you type "a" and run that as a line of code into the chunk, you should see the number "3" appear below the chunk and in the Console.

```{r}
1+1
a <- 1+2
a
```


## Packages and Libraries

R, like Stata, has a number of in-built functions, referred to as 'Base R'. Given R's open source nature, a number of individuals have written useful _packages_, which extend the functionality of R by providing a number of _functions_ to do common tasks. There is some ongoing debate in the R world surrounding overreliance on user-written packages versus using exclusively Base R. One of the drawbacks of relying on packages is that packages may change from version to version, necessitating occasional updates to your old code. Some statisticians prefer to use Base R as coding each function that may be needed explicitly is useful for comprehension of the underlying workings of a particular statistical (or data management) process. Other statisticians will use packages to make their code more streamlined, easier to read, and or more efficient. Using packages also prevents the R user from "reinventing the wheel" - if someone else has already done the legwork to provide a custom function for you, it saves time to use it! 

This guide to R is written using a number of packages - without them, our task would be made substantially more difficult, given that many of the commands built into Stata are not built in to Base R. We will have to rely on packages for some of the analyses we encounter. We install packages using the install.packages() command. You should only have to install packages once - if they have been downloaded to your LSHTM account or to your laptop, you should not have to install them again. Because of the way the computers are set up at the school, you may receive a prompt when installing packages to install them in a different directory - click yes if prompted. You will know a package has successfully been installed if it appears in the 'Packages' tab in the bottom right pane of RStudio. It is possible you may have to run the install.packages() command more than once to successfully install a package.

```{r}
#--- Install packages
install.packages(c("foreign", "magrittr", "psych", "epiDisplay", "tidyverse"))
```


After installing a package, before you can use it you must load its functions from its library. This is done with the library() command. 
```{r}

```





So far, in the pen and paper practicals, you have worked with summary level data in the form of tables of percentages, frequencies, means, standard deviations, etc. When moving to the computer practicals, we will work from the original (raw) data. So a statistical analysis will allow us to reproduce these tables before we analyse. These data are held in a file (normally a .csv file, or a .dta file). For R to work, the data must first be read in. After reading in the data, we can apply a series of commands to either manipulate or analyse the data. To see this in action, we will use R to carry out some simple analyses on the BAB.dta dataset. As with Stata, you will need to copy the datafiles for the practicals to your home drive. In order to do this, you will need to copy the files located in "U:\\download\\teach\\steph" to a folder on your H:\\ drive.
